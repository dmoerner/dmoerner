## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel Moerner!

I have a PhD in philosophy from Yale University and spent the last five years working as an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago. I've always had a passion for open-source development, and I realized just how much I enjoyed when my work gave me the opportunity to use code to tackle a problem. I just completed a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), and I'm now looking for new challenges in full-stack, frontend, or backend development.

Some of my recent interests include:

* Peer to peer networks: Check out my BitTorrent tracker [etracker](https://github.com/dmoerner/etracker) and my BitTorrent client [pytorrent](https://github.com/dmoerner/pytorrent), which was developed jointly with [Lamone Armstrong](https://github.com/l-armstrong)
* Games or projects designed to be frustrating or annoying: I've written an idle clicker [svelteclick](https://github.com/dmoerner/svelteclick) and a dissonant music generator [badbach](https://github.com/dmoerner/badbach).
* Database design, especially at scale.
